            My name is Courtney and I am an authorised marriage celebrant… also known as professional storyteller, curious and compassionate listener and enthusiastic lover of humans and life. 

I’m married and a mama to three little people, as well as having a career as a Psychologist. While I don’t provide psychological services as part of my celebrant work, I believe it makes me uniquely qualified to listen, understand and relay your love, and loss, stories. 

Why become a Celebrant with all that going on? Well, I delight in hearing people’s stories and celebrating joy, creative writing, public speaking and I even love paperwork! 

My books are open now for all manner of ceremonies, from weddings to baby naming ceremonies, funerals to vow renewals and everything in between. 

All stages of life are worth celebrating, so what are you waiting for? Get in touch today! ✨
