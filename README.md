### My first Client
My first client is a fellow mum who I met through a large band of mothers who had a child in 2018. I reached out to the group to extend my services as an emerging software developer and was able to land my very first client. An up and coming Celebrant!

### Collaboration
So far we have briefly discussed what I am able to offer and what the client is hoping to achieve. The client went beyond my expectations and organised logos and well put together colour scheme, which offers some good direction and is a great start to the project.
